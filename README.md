## Game Play
### Description
Silicon Valley is a game that allows players to explore the companies in Silicon Valley. The companies include Microsoft, Google, Apple, and Facebook. 

### How To Play
Click one of the players to becomes logged in. WHen all players have logged in, the game will start. 

When the game starts, You will see a die. Once you click the screen, the number that the die lands on is the number of spaces your player will move. After every player has moved, a mini game will begin. Try to get as high os a score as you can. Your results will be accessible on the STATS page. There is a link on the left hand side of the screen in the navigation bar.


## Development
### Required Elements
Your project must demonstrate clear and effective use of all of the technologies, tools, or techniques from this list (be sure to itemize these clearly in your README file, along with some specific file/lineNumber citations into your own code):

1. Javascript (including creating your own objects but not with inheritance)
- Javascript is the core of our game. We have many js files in static/gameplay.js and the javascript for each minigames is in src folder. (Minigame1 connects with src1 folder, and so on). 
	
2. Canvas
We have 2 main canvases on the main page, and our mini games each use canvas. 

3. HTML (including a reasonably wide range of techniques, such as tables, forms with form validation, etc)
static/index.html and static/game.html are our main files. 

4. CSS (including a reasonably range of techniques, such as reset, pseudo-selectors, fixed and fluid layout, etc)
- We have separate files for css for clarity. in static/style.css all the style for the page is held. There is some extra css in static/style/mini1.css which holds css for the games. 

5. DOM manipulation
- For our chat screen, we are loading the messages into the message view. After message submission, the message is input into the DOM and visible inthe chat box. 

6. JQuery
- This page originally loads all the content from the game.html page and alot of the content is set to `dispay:none;` in the CSS files. JQuery accesses the DOM and changes the display so that it is nwo visible. JQuery allows for beautification and fading in and out. 


7. AJAX client (consume an API)

8. AJAX server (provide an API)
- App.JS
