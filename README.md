## Game Play
### Description
This game is .....

### How To Play
First You... **TBD**.

## Development
### Intended Implementation
_to make sure we're all on the same page while working remotely_

### Required Elements
Your project must demonstrate clear and effective use of all of the technologies, tools, or techniques from this list (be sure to itemize these clearly in your readme file, along with some specific file/lineNumber citations into your own code):
1. Javascript (including creating your own objects but not with inheritance)
2. Canvas

   _Note: some of you may find it challenging to include a canvas in some natural way.  Even so, it's a required element.  In your term project, you'll have more flexibility to include or omit various elements, but not here.  
You must showcase all of them, including canvas.  But with some cleverness, you can think of something compelling.  It need not be the central theme of your app.  Maybe just a really clever button, or some small but compelling visual element.  Be clever, and find a way to include it meaningfully._

3. HTML (including a reasonably wide range of techniques, such as tables, forms with form validation, etc)
4. CSS (including a reasonably range of techniques, such as reset, pseudo-selectors, fixed and fluid layout, etc)
5. DOM manipulation
6. jQuery
7. AJAX client (consume an API)
8. AJAX server (provide an API)
